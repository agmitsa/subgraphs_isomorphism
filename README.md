# subgraphs_isomorphism
Python project that solves the subgraph isomorphism problem. It finds if a graph consist a subgraph of another graph by making a 1:1 match between the nodes of each graph and its neighbour nodes. 
The result is a mapping between the nodes of two graphs and the number of calls. For this project I used two algortihms, a simple and a refined one that executes the program with less calls.

You can find more about the subgraph isomorphsim problem in this link -> https://nbviewer.org/github/dmst-algorithms-course/assignment-2019-4/blob/master/assignment_2019_4.ipynb.
